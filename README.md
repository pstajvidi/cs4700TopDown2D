# cs4700TopDown2D Assignment
Created a top down 2d game using the tutorials provided, specifically: 
- [Topdown 2d rpg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfgyI1RkVo4&list=PLLtCXwcEVtulmgxqM_cA8hjIWkSNMWuie)
- [Top down game tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5TOpRmQh-o&list=PLaaFfzxy_80HtVvBnpK_IjSC8_Y9AOhuP) for the Inventory and saving aspects

## Features
- Player movement: WASD for basic controls and T for slashing
- Enemy AI: Skeletons will charge at player when the player gets close to them, they will also retreat when player moves away from them
- Both enemy and player have health systems
- the inventory system will collect the flowers in, and store them until full. When objects are in the inventory they can be moved with a mouse.
- the game is able be saved and booted back up to its new altered state. 

## Scenario:
The main focus of the game is a lost knight, who has to find his way back to the front lines. To do see he needs to collect enough flowers to be able to tend to his wounds and get through his journey. Specifically in the butchered poem in the player tab in the inventory "Oh loyal knight why so far, please try to get back to the front lines. Heal with flowers and beat the should of dead!" 

## Challenges
Some of the challenges that I faced were mainly due to the video I began with. Since the playlist ends abruptly, for the inventory system and the remaining aspects I had to look for other videos and implement them as best as I could, to fit with what I already had. I would have liked to work more on the story, and buttons. Overall I would have preferred to have more functionality for the game as well as to have made more interesting, such as adding in a timer.
